INIT - obv dont use SkysBranch .. thats mine.

cd c:/I/dont/fucking/know  						//Navigates to local directory
cd ..									//Navigates out of current directory because your a fuckup
git init 								//Adds some default information to allow sync
git pull https://github.com/yoayo112/Change-The-Game.git		//Populates your local directory with current data
git status								//Shows your relationship to the origin. 
									// -> should say "Working tree clean. Nothing to commit".
git checkout -b SkysBranch						//Switches the working directory to your branch. *CAP SENSITIVE*.
git branch								//Shows the available branches. 
									// -> current branch (SkysBranch) should be green with a star next to it. 
git remote add origin https://github.com/yoayo112/Change-The-Game.git	//Creates an "origin" variable to be the working dir. And your dir to be remote.
git push -u origin SkysBranch						//Connects your local "SkysBranch" with remote "SkysBranch" via tracking.
									// ^^^ Important! Pushes you make will now track with your branch.
									// ^^^ Note: you don't actually need to push any changes. Tracking will still be setup.
									// All Done :)

LOGIN

// If at any point you see:

Fatal HttpRequestException encountered
Username for 'https://github.com':

//This means github wants you to login to make sure your not some random weirdo pushing to a repository.
//(I mean, current wierdos excluded ovbiously)

//Enter your username and tap 'Enter'

//Unfortunately, github has recently done away with password authentication (kinda dumb tbh).
//Soooo, even though it will then say 

Password for 'http://github.com':

//It wont take your password. XD (We love it! <3)
//What it really wants is a unique token/key value that you make instead. 
//Navigate to github.com
//Upper right corner- click your cute little profile pic ;)
//Click "Settings" from that drop down menu (near the bottom)
//On the settings page, on the left hand side, literally the last item in that list, click "Developer Settings"
//Click "Personal Access Tokens" then -> "Tokens (Classic)"
//Click "Generate new token"
//I prefer the classic token, since the fine grained repo is still in beta testing. 
//Add a note, Something like: "Access only granted to gods among men". 
// ("Suck deez nutzz" is also acceptable)
//Set the expiration date. 
//If this is your primary machine, and you will be using it indefinitely you can set no expiration date.
//Otherwwise, its probably smart to set it to only have temporary access, because this token will be remembered by this local machine. 
//If I was using a computer in the public library, I would want my key to expire asap.
//Select all permissions, because clearly we are supreme gods among men and should not be restriced from ultimate power.
//Click "Generate Token".
//IMPORTANT// Copy this little fucker. Once you navigate away from this page it will be gone forever!!
//I like to throw mine in my notes file for the project, a .txt, a comment at the top of my code, a README..
//If somehow you get logged out, or loose your clipboard, at least you will still have this key. 
//Ctrl+V this little gremlin back in cmd shell

Password for 'http://github.com':

//and now this program, on this machine, will auto-authorize you for the duration of that token. It will not ask you to log in again.
// :)

WORKFLOW
--------

Open cmd
cd whatever/your/path/is					//go to your local directory
git pull origin master						//Please for the love of god, pull everytime!
								//-> currently I have been working on this project most days, often in the middle of the night.
								//This pull is super important, without this, you might find your branch behind the master.
								// -> i.e. there are changes on the master that you dont have. and your push may not work.
								// -> Worse case scenario, you pull, and you are already up to date with the master.
git status							//If for any reason you want to know where you stand in relation to the master.
								

MAKE CH-CH-CH-CHANGES (Time may change me-ee, But I can't trace time!)
//^^ Game Development
//Please keep files and assets organized! <3 This is like the digital equivalent of being roomates and I will be sad if I have to do your dishes. 

git add *							//* == all files.
 --OR--
git add -A							//-A == all directory changes (including file deletion). 
--OR-- 
git add <filename>						//<filename> just a single file.
								//Theres way more things you can do here to implement and control your changes.

git commit -m "The godliest commit ever known to mankind"	//"Suck deez nutzz" also acceptable.
								//generally its nice to see a breif description of what you added or changed.
								// i.e. "fixed clipping bug while running" or "added a dope minigame!"
git push							//your changes now exist ethereally everywhere. Well at least on some server somewhere.
								//Note: This just pushes changes to YOUR branch. This will not merge changes into the master.



-------
MERGING - Below is sort of redundant but is best practice for safety.
-------

git checkout master						//Switch to the master branch
git pull origin master						//Redundant insurance that everything is up to date.
								//This will fix a headache if someone merged since you last pulled.
								//You may see merge conflicts here and we need to make sure they all get fixed before a real push
git merge origin/SkysBranch						//Pulls all the changes from SkysBranch into the master.
								//You may see more merge conflicts. Please fix them or ask for help!

git push origin master						//pushes the master branch to the cloud.
git checkout SkysBranch						//Sets the whole thing up again for next time
								// All Done :)
