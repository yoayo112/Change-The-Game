# Change-The-Game
A game that I am building and designing using unity, C#, and blender. Implementation and design are based on concepts and creative design by Sam Stagner (@ RonkyKong) who is also responsible for almost all static visual assets. Started in December of 2023.

Authors: Schuyler Vercauteren, Samuel Stagner.
